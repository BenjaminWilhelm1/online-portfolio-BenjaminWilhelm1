## Self-Reflection:

I was rusty with HTML and CSS but I came back to me. I had to watch some refresher videos to get me up to speed. Overall I felt great. I love getting back into HTML and CSS and I have a lot goals for my web page. 

I have some issues with the testing, I have 5 div sections named "section" and it told me I have 0.

### How long it took me to finish this?
This assignment took me over 2 hours. If you add the refresher videos and github setup videos then it would be closer to 4.
